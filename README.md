Official repository of the **** 2023 paper "ClusT3: Information Invariant Test-Time Training", by Gustavo A. Vargas Hakim, David Osowiechi, Mehrdad Noori, Milad Cheraghalikhani, Ali Bahri, Ismail Ben Ayed, and Christian Desrosiers.
The whole article can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/*********).
This work was greatly inspired by the code in [TTTFlow](https://github.com/GustavoVargasHakim/TTTFlow/).

We propose a novel unsupervised TTT technique based on the maximization of Mutual Information between multi-scale feature maps and a discrete latent representation, which can be integrated to the standard training as an auxiliary clustering task.
